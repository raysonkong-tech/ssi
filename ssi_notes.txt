# how to use SSI (Server side include) ##
When building a simple multi-page html site,
the nav bar and footer are often codes that are repeared in all html files as they are present on all pages. 

The Goal of SSI is to extract these repeated code to a single file such as header.html and footer.html, and use SSI to include those code in the right places.

## Example

1. On an html page

    <body>
        <? include "navbar.html"; ?>

        <!-- Your html page-->
    </body>

2. Create navbar.html and extract code there

3. change all html files to php files:
  E.g. index.html ---> index.php

4. Enjoy dry code!
